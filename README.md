# PRODIGY_DS_01
## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **World Population dataset**. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and understand factors influencing population trends across different countries.

## Task Objective
This project fulfills the requirements of Task 1 from my internship at Prodigy InfoTech:
- Perform data cleaning on a chosen dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Identify relationships, patterns, and trends in the data.

## Dataset
**Source:** World Population dataset.

**Description:** The World Population dataset provides detailed information about the population of various countries over several years. The dataset includes key features like:

- **Country Name:** Name of the country.
- **Country Code:** Code representing the country.
- **Series Name:** Description of the data series (e.g., Population, total).
- **Series Code:** Code representing the data series.
- **Years (2001-2022):** Population data for each year from 2001 to 2022.

## Key Steps

1- **Data Cleaning**
  - Handled missing values in the dataset.
  - Removed unnecessary columns like 'Series Name' and 'Country Name'.
  - Ensured data consistency and correctness.

2- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Univariate Analysis:** Explored individual features like total population for specific years.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Analyzed relationships between features (e.g., Population vs. Country).
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Studied combined effects of features like population trends over years.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Evaluated numerical relationships between variables.

 3- **Key Visualizations**
- Top 10 countries with the highest total population in 2022 and 2016.
- Bottom 10 countries with the lowest total population in 2022 and 2016.
- Population trends over the years for selected countries.

## Insights
- **Top 10 Countries:** India, China, and the USA consistently have the highest populations.
- **Bottom 10 Countries:** Countries like Tuvalu, Nauru, and Palau have the lowest populations.
- **Population Trends:** Some countries show significant population growth over the years, while others remain relatively stable.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** Analysis and visualization.
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Conclusion
This project successfully performed **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis** on the World Population dataset. Relationships, patterns, and trends were identified, offering clear insights into population dynamics across different countries.
